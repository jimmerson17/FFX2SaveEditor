# FFX2SaveEditor
Quick and dirty mod of Meth962's work.  Changed to support the Switch.  See his repo for details.

A save editor for FFX2 on Switch

## How to Use
* Use Checkpoint to dump your saves, then follow PC directions.
* For PC, just open any of the "ffx2_###" files.
* When changing your Gil, hit the Enter key to finish editing the amount.
* Any menu you go into, use the same button to get back.
* Use your scroll wheel inside quantity inputs (like item count) to quickly add or remove quantity.
   * Just name it any ffx2_### (but don't overwrite your own saves :) just pick a different number)
   
## Warning
It's kinda buggy, but it works ish.
